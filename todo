1. test checkNeq on records, arrays, nils etc. once finished with SeqExp
    - t2
2. checkNeq of names, strings? If no, remove tenv
3. can you compare strings with other operands?
4. actual type with names
5. eqType with name
6. Change to sameActualType in vardec
7. What type should we return if we don't find it in the table in vardec
8. loop stuff in transdec(A.TypeDec)
